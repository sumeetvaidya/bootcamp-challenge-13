# bootcamp-challenge-13 : Venture Funding with Deep Learning

Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. The goal is to create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The input is a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The goal is to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. The CSV file contains a variety of information about these businesses, including whether or not they ultimately became successful.

## Technologies 
<br/>
The project is written in python and uses the sklearn and tensorflow modules.
<br/>


## Installation Guide  
<br/>
To install the program, download the git repo and run the Jupyter notebook
<br/>

<br/>

## Results
<br/>
There are three models that are used for analysis. <br/>
* Model  uses loss function Binary Crossentropy with 50 epochs and has a loss rate of 55% and accuracy of 73%. <br/>
* Alternate Model 1 uses loss function Mean Squared Error with 50 epochs and has a loss rate of 18.5% and accuracy of 73% <br/>
* Alternate Model 2 uses loss function of Mean Square Logarithmic Eror with 25 epochs and has a loss rate of 9% and accuracy of 73% <br/>
<br/>

| Name  |  Loss Function |  Epochs |  Number of Layers |  Loss Rate |  Accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  Model | Binary Crossentropy  | 50  | 3  | 55%  | 73%  |
|  Alternate Model 1 | Mean Squared Error  | 50  | 2  | 18.5%  | 73%  |
|  Alternate Model 2 | Mean Square Logarithmic Eror  | 25  | 2  | 9%  | 73%  |
